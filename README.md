# The Extensible API for Reconnaissance (EAR) Project

## About

The EAR project is an application designed to make it easy to discover interesting data about organizations, users, computers, and networks on the web, using common (and not so common) OSINT techniques. 

The core of the EAR project is the object model (implemented and database-backed with Active Record) and the tasks (implemented as small ruby scripts) to modify and create objects. EAR tasks are simple to create, have just enough structure, and harness the full power of ruby to extend the EAR framework in useful ways.

EAR keeps track of objects generated by each task for you. For example, if you add a host object, and run a 'geolocate_host' task, you'll find that the physical address generated by the task is now a child of that host (and the host is now a parent of that physical address). You can view, modify, and programmatically query and inspect these relationships.

## News

* 06/18/2012 - Cleaned up Web UI and background tasks! Now with less stupid!
* 02/25/2012 - The EAR Project has a stubbed out web UI, and is on its way to v1.0
* 12/16/2011 - The EAR Project has been updated to Rails 3!

## Prerequisites and Initial Setup:

The EAR is currently tested and working on:

* OS X 10.5.x+
* Ubuntu Linux 9.10+

The following prerequisites are required for execution: 

### Prerequisites (Debian / Ubuntu) 

All prerequisites can be installed via apt:

	sudo apt-get install nmap qt4-qmake libnokogiri-ruby1.8 libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libqt4-dev libpcap-dev libpq-dev libsqlite3-dev 

### Prerequisites (OSX using Brew)

Brew can be used to install prerequisites on OSX:

	brew install qt
	brew install nmap

### Initial Setup (platform independent): 

Execute the bundle installer: 

	$ gem install bundle 
	$ bundle install      # from within the ear application root
  $ rake setup:initial  # from within the ear application root

## Getting Started with the EAR

### Using the Web Interface (Start Here!)

Simply browse to http://localhost:3000 on the system running EAR, and create objects / run tasks!

### Using the Scriptable Console (Advanced)
Once you have a database, simply run `$ util/console.rb` - this will give you access to a pry shell from which you can create objects and run tasks. 

Creating a host object & running tasks: 

    ear> h = Host.create(:ip_address => "8.8.8.8")
    ear> h.run_task("dns_reverse_lookup")
    ear> h.run_task("geolocate_host")
    ear> h.children

You can also access the interface on the web, by running '`$ rails s' in the root of the EAR directory. This will set up a server on :3000 - Note that this is extremely alpha, and is currently not supported. 

## Advanced

### Configuration files

The ear_api_keys.yml file configures API key required for API operations and where they may be located. 

The database.yml file can also be configured with the following databases:

	* SQLite3 - For light / small scale test database operations and development. **Used by default
	* MySQL / Postgres - For heavier / long term operations and development.
    
The latest geolitecity data cand be pulled by running: 

  $ data/geolitecity/get_latest.sh 

### Additional Utilities

The EAR ships with a few utilities which you may find of use:

 - util/sniff.rb: This utility sets up a packet sniffer on the local machine, which automatically creates Host objects within the EAR's database. These host objects are then available to you within the EAR. This is a fun & easy way to find out more information about the systems your host is communicating with.

 - util/load_*.rb: Use these utilities to load a list of hosts into the system. Optionally, you can run modules against the objects you import. It's likely you'll want to take a look at the code before running them. 

Check out the utils/ directory for more utils.

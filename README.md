## About

Tapir is a framework designed to make it easy to discover data about entities - organizations, users, computers, and networks - on the web, using common (and not so common) OSINT techniques.

At the core of Tapir are entities, implemented and database-backed with MongoDB, and the tasks (implemented as small, structured ruby scripts like Metasploit modules) to modify and create entities. Tapir entities are real-world objects that you want to discover more information about.

Tapir tasks are the code that operate on the entities to create findings, new entities, or modify existing entities. Tasks are simple to create, have just enough structure, and harness the power of Ruby to extend the framework in useful ways. Have a look at the existing tasks in the lib/tapir/tasks directory.

Tapir keeps track of entities generated by each task for you. For example, if you add a host entity, and run a 'geolocate_host' task, you'll find that the physical address generated by the task is now a child of that host (and the host is now a parent of that physical address). You can view, modify, and programmatically query and inspect these relationships.

## Prerequisites:

Tapir is currently tested and working on:

* OS X 10.5.x+
* Ubuntu Linux 9.10+

### Prerequisites Installation (Debian / Ubuntu) 

These prerequisites can be installed via apt:

	sudo apt-get install nmap qt4-qmake libnokogiri-ruby1.8 libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libqt4-dev libpcap-dev libpq-dev libsqlite3-dev 

Mongo can be installed with the following: 

	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10
	echo 'deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/10gen.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install mongodb-10gen

See: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/ for more information

### Prerequisites Installation (OSX using Brew)

Brew can be used to install prerequisites on OSX:

	brew install qt
	brew install nmap
	brew install mongo

### Initial Tapir setup (platform independent): 

Execute the bundle installer: 

	$ gem install bundle                # from within the application root
	$ bundle install                    # from within the application root
	$ bundle exec rake secret > .secret # from within the application root

## Getting Started with Tapir

### Using the Web Interface (Start Here!)

To start the server, in the root of the Tapir directory, run: 

	$ bundle exec rackup                # to start the server

	Now browse to http://[server_name]:9292 

In order to log in, you'll need to generate a username and password. 

	$ bundle exec rake db:seed           # to generate a username and password

### Configure data sources
		
Most data sources are available with just an internet connection. Some require you to pull down data in advance. 

The latest geolitecity (geolocation) data can be pulled by running: 

	$ cd [tapir_root]/data
	$ ./geolitecity/get_latest.sh 

### Using the Scriptable Console (Advanced)
Once you have a database, simply run `$ bundle exec ./util/console.rb` - this will give you access to a shell from which you can create entities and run tasks against them. 

Creating a host entity & running tasks: 

	$ cd [tapir_root]/util
	$ bundle exec ./console.rb

		tapir> Tenant.current = Tenant.first
		tapir> Project.current = Project.first
		tapir> host = Entities::Host.create(:name => "8.8.8.8")
		tapir> host.run_task("dns_reverse_lookup",{})
		tapir> host.run_task("geolocate_host",{})
		tapir> host.children.map{ |c| puts "#{c.class}: #{c.name}" };

### Known Issues

Installation of therubyracer gem might fail due to an invalid GEM specification file, refer to the following link for details:
